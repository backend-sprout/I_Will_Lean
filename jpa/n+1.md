# 🏫 N+1 문제 
> 조회 시 1개의 쿼리를 생각하고 설계를 했으나 나오지 않아도 되는 조회의 쿼리가 N개가 더 발생하는 문제.
  
영속성을 관리하지 못해서 발생하는 문제다.     
  
## 📚 준비물 
### Team(One)
```java
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PROTECTED)
@Entity
public class Team {

    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String teamName;

    @OneToMany
    private List<User> user = new ArrayList<>();

    @Builder
    public Team(final String teamName) {
        this.teamName = teamName;
    }
}
```

### User(Many)
```java
@Getter
@NoArgsConstructor(access = AccessLevel.PROTECTED)
@Entity
public class User {

    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;

    private String username;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id")
    private Team team;

    @Builder
    public User(final String username, final Team team) {
        this.username = username;
        this.team = team;
    }
}
```

### SomenThing
```java
@Entity
public class SomeThing {
    
    @Id @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }
}
```

### Test
```java
@DataJpaTest
public class NPlusOneTest {

    @Autowired
    private TestEntityManager testEntityManager;

    @Autowired
    private TeamRepository teamRepository;

    @Autowired
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    private List<Team> teams;

    private List<User> users;

    @BeforeEach
    void setUp() {
        teams = IntStream.range(0, 10)
                .mapToObj(i -> "teamName" + i)
                .map(Team::new)
                .collect(Collectors.toList());
        teamRepository.saveAll(teams);

        users = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
                final User user = new User("username" + i + "" + j, teams.get(i));
                users.add(user);
            }
        }
        userRepository.saveAll(users);

        teamRepository.flush();
        userRepository.flush();
        System.out.println("\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n");
    }
}
```

# 📕 EAGER  
> EAGER는 감싼 엔티티(단일)에 대해서 연관된 영속 객체들을 가져오는 것  
  
## 📖 OneToMany
**Team(One)**
```java
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "team", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private List<User> user = new ArrayList<>();
```

### 📄 findById  
#### 🧑🏻‍💻 코드 
```java
    @Test
    void oneToManyFindById() {
        testEntityManager.clear();
        final Team team = teamRepository.findById(1L).get();
        System.out.println("=====Start=======");
        team.getUser().stream()
            .map(User::getUsername)
            .forEach(System.out::println);
        System.out.println("=====End=======");
    }
```

#### 💡 결과 
```shell
=====Start=======
Hibernate: 
    select 
        team0_.id as id1_1_0_, 
        team0_.team_name as team_nam2_1_0_, 
        user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_1_, 
        user1_.id as id1_2_1_, 
        user1_.id as id1_2_2_, 
        user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_2_, 
        user1_.username as username2_2_2_ 
    from team team0_ 
    left outer join user user1_ on team0_.id=user1_.team_id 
    where team0_.id=? 
    // 한방 쿼리 
username00
....
username09
=====End=======
```
  
* `findById == Join`   
* Join을 사용했기 때문에, `List<User>`에 대한 영속성을 일일히 가져오는게 아니라 한번에 가져왔다.     

### 📄 findAll 

#### 🧑🏻‍💻 코드
```java
    @Test
    void oneToManyFindAll() {
        testEntityManager.clear();

        final List<Team> teams = teamRepository.findAll();
        System.out.println("=====Start=======");
        for (Team team : teams) {
            team.getUser().stream()
                    .map(User::getUsername)
                    .forEach(System.out::println);
        }
        System.out.println("=====End=======");
    }
```

* findAll()은 원래 쿼리상 `select team0_.id as id1_1_, team0_.team_name as team_nam2_1_ from team team0_`로 끝난다.   
* 그러나, EAGER에 따라 `팀하나 + 여러 유저(select user from user where team.id = user.team_id)` 구문이 실행된다.     
* 앞서 말했듯이 EAGER는 감싼 엔티티(단일)에 대해서 연관된 영속 객체들을 가져오는 것이므로, 단일 팀에 맞추어 user select를 호출한 것이다.  
* 더 쉽게 설명하면 EAGER의 경우 무조건 WHERE로 검색한다. 
* 단, OneToMany에서는 Join이지만, ManyToOne에서는 그냥 where 절로 가져온다.(즉 ManyToOne은 쿼리가 한번 더 날라간다)  
* 그렇기에 `List<Entity>` 에 대해서 단일로 단위로 가져와서 N+1이 발생한다.    


## 📖 ManyToOne  

**User**
```java
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id", nullable = false)
    private Team team;
```

### 📄 findById

#### 🧑🏻‍💻 코드  
```java
    @Test
    void manyToOneFindById() {
        testEntityManager.clear();

        System.out.println("=====Start=======");
        final User user = userRepository.findById(1L).get();
        user.getTeam().getTeamName();
        System.out.println("=====End=======");
    }
```
  
#### 💡 결과  
```java
=====Start=======

Hibernate: select user0_.team_id as team_id3_2_0_, user0_.id as id1_2_0_, user0_.id as id1_2_1_, user0_.team_id as team_id3_2_1_, user0_.username as username2_2_1_ from user user0_ where user0_.team_id=?
=====End=======
```

* OneToMany의 findById는 Join 이었던 것과 달리, ManyToOne의 findById는 Where 를 통한 추가 조회 로직이다.   
* 이를 하나의 쿼리로 나타내려면 아무래도 조인을 써야할 것 같다. 

### 📄 findByAll
**코드**
```java
    @Test
    void manyToOneFindAll() {
        testEntityManager.clear();

        System.out.println("=====Start=======");
        final List<User> users = userRepository.findAll();
        users.stream().map(User::getTeam)
                .map(Team::getTeamName)
                .forEach(System.out::println);
        System.out.println("=====End=======");
    }

* EAGER는 엔티티(단일)을 기준으로 값을 가져온다.     
* 더불어 ManyToOne 이므로, 각각의 엔티티에 맞는 Team을 조회해서 가져오고 있다.     
* 이를 해결하려면 마찬가지로 조인을 하는것이 좋다.
