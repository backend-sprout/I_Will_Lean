# 🏫 N+1 문제 
> 조회 시 1개의 쿼리를 생각하고 설계를 했으나 나오지 않아도 되는 조회의 쿼리가 N개가 더 발생하는 문제.
  
영속성을 관리하지 못해서 발생하는 문제다.

* findAll()은 원래 쿼리상 `select team0_.id as id1_1_, team0_.team_name as team_nam2_1_ from team team0_`로 끝난다.   
* 그러나, EAGER에 따라 `팀하나 + 여러 유저(select user from user where team.id = user.team_id)` 구문이 실행된다.     
* 앞서 말했듯이 EAGER는 감싼 엔티티(단일)에 대해서 연관된 영속 객체들을 가져오는 것이므로, 단일 팀에 맞추어 user select를 호출한 것이다.  
* 더 쉽게 설명하면 EAGER의 경우 무조건 WHERE로 검색한다. 
* 단, OneToMany에서는 Join이지만, ManyToOne에서는 그냥 where 절로 가져온다.(즉 ManyToOne은 쿼리가 한번 더 날라간다)  
* 그렇기에 `List<Entity>` 에 대해서 단일로 단위로 가져와서 N+1이 발생한다.    


## 📖 ManyToOne  

**User**
```java
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    @JoinColumn(name = "team_id", nullable = false)
    private Team team;
```

### 📄 findById
#### 🧑🏻‍💻 코드 - Team의 OneToMany가 EAGER 인 경우
**Team이 Eager 가질경우**
```java
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "team", fetch = FetchType.EAGER)
    private List<User> user = new ArrayList<>();
```
#### 💡 결과  
```java
=====Start=======
Hibernate: select user0_.id as id1_2_0_, user0_.team_id as team_id3_2_0_, user0_.username as username2_2_0_, team1_.id as id1_1_1_, team1_.team_name as team_nam2_1_1_ from user user0_ inner join team team1_ on user0_.team_id=team1_.id where user0_.id=?
Hibernate: select user0_.team_id as team_id3_2_0_, user0_.id as id1_2_0_, user0_.id as id1_2_1_, user0_.team_id as team_id3_2_1_, user0_.username as username2_2_1_ from user user0_ where user0_.team_id=?
=====End=======
```

* OneToMany의 findById는 Join 이었던 것과 달리, ManyToOne의 findById는 Where 를 통한 추가 조회 로직이다.   
* 아마도 Join을 사용하지 않으므로 EAGER + ManyToOne 특징에 따라 엔티티에 맞는 Team을 찾은 것 같다.    
* 아래 나올 findAll 컬렉션을 반환하니까 이 구문을 여러번 호출한 느낌이다.     
* 이를 해결하기 위해서는 당연하게도 조인을 해야한다.       


#### 🧑🏻‍💻 코드2 - Team의 OneToMany가 LAZY 인 경우
```java
    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "team", fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    private List<User> user = new ArrayList<>();
```

* Team의 OneToMany가 Lazy인 경우, Join 문을 실행한다;

* 최소 2번의 쿼리가 발생한다.    
* findById는 Eager일 경우 Join 최적화(단, EAGER/EAGER 유저(Many)에서 검색은 예외)

  
# 🤔 해결법  
## JPQL 사용(Where 대신 FetchJoin 사용하기)    

* where 사용한다면? : Join 최적화 없이 모든 조회가 N+1이 발생할 것이다(기존 조인 최적화도 없앨 것이므로)  
* 그냥 Join은? : 그냥 조인은 테이블을 연결해서 값을 가져오지만, 영속성을 가져오지 않기 때문에 호출시 영속성 조회 쿼리가 날라간다.  

### Team
#### TeamRepository
```java
public interface TeamRepository extends JpaRepository<Team, Long> {

    @Query("select t from Team t join fetch t.user where t.id =:id")
    Optional<Team> findByIdFetchJoin(final Long id);

    @Query("select t from Team t join fetch t.user")
    List<Team> findAllFetchJoin();

    @Query("select t from Team t join fetch t.user")
    Set<Team> findAllFetchJoinSet();

    @Query("select distinct t from Team t join fetch t.user")
    List<Team> findAllFetchJoinDistinct();
}
```

#### findByIdFetchJoin
```shell
=====Start=======
Hibernate: select team0_.id as id1_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, team0_.team_name as team_nam2_1_0_, user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_1_, user1_.username as username2_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_0__, user1_.id as id1_2_0__ from team team0_ inner join user user1_ on team0_.id=user1_.team_id where team0_.id=?
=====End=======
```
* 단일 요소에 대해서 검색 + 패치조인이기에 쿼리가 한번 나간다.  

#### findAllFetchJoin

```shell
Hibernate: select team0_.id as id1_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, team0_.team_name as team_nam2_1_0_, user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_1_, user1_.username as username2_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_0__, user1_.id as id1_2_0__ from team team0_ inner join user user1_ on team0_.id=user1_.team_id

10번 반복 -> 중복된 데이터 계속 출력 
[ username00 ]
| username01 |
[ .......... ]

10번 반복 -> 중복된 데이터 계속 출력 
[ username10 ]
| username11 |
[ .......... ]

... * 10
```
* 마찬가지로 조인을 이용했기에 쿼리한방으로 해결이 가능하다.   
* 단, oneToMany같은 경우, 하나의 엔티티에 여러 값이 존재하므로 
* 기본적인 행의 개수는 Many 부분의 개수만큼 증가한다(Many 값이 하나씩 들어가니까)

#### findAllFetchJoinSet/findAllFetchJoinDistinct(findAllFetchJoin - 해결)
  
```shell
=====Start=======
Hibernate: select team0_.id as id1_1_0_, user1_.id as id1_2_1_, team0_.team_name as team_nam2_1_0_, user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_1_, user1_.username as username2_2_1_, user1_.team_id as team_id3_2_0__, user1_.id as id1_2_0__ from team team0_ inner join user user1_ on team0_.id=user1_.team_id
username00
username01
...

* Set/이나 distinct를 사용하면 OneToMany에 대해서 최적화를 진행할 수 있다.          
* 두 방식 모두 데이터베이스/애플리케이션에서 중복을 제거하고 값을 들여오기 때문이다.      
* **단, 이렇게 하더라도 OneToMany 패치조인에 대해서 페이징을 진행할 수 없다.**
